		<div class="content">
			<p> <!-- what -->
			LexSciBowl is a unique student-run middle school science competition, 
			run by members of Lexington High School Science Bowl/Olympiad Teams 
			for teams in the Greater Boston Area. Teams of 4-5 members will compete 
			in both a written olympiad modeled on the 
			<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_Olympiad">International Science Olympiads</a> 
			and a buzzer tournament modeled on the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/">National Science Bowl</a>.
			LSB 2017 will also feature events based on the <a href="http://nosb.org">National Ocean Sciences Bowl</a> 
			and/or <a href="https://massenvirothon.org/">Environthon</a>. 	
			</p>
			<!-- where-->
			<!--
			<br> We're holding LexSciBowl at <a href="//www.google.com/maps/place/Lexington+High+School/">Lexington High School</a> 
			in the Science Lecture Hall. 
			Just show up at one of the entrances to the school between 8:00 and 8:30 on April 2nd, 
			and signs and volunteers will direct you to the right place. (see the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> 
			for more details)-->
			 <!--EDIT THIS and who-->
			<p> <!-- who -->
			Our competition is targeted toward middle school students (grades 6-8), but we can also accept younger students 
			if they feel they are ready! Although age and experience will certainly help a team get further in the elimination 
			tournament, there will be multiple brackets to allow all students to explore a lot of science and participate 
			in as many rounds of competition as possible.

			<div class="box" id="faq-signup"><h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
				<p>
					Registration for 2017 is now closed, but you can join our <a href="/#register">waitlists</a>.
					If you have signed up already, please check your emails for confirmation information and important forms. 
					Please remember that each team must be accompanied by an adult coach throughout the event.
					<!--<a href="/#register">Register here</a>. We aim to have 16 competing teams this year.
					There will be an initial limit of 2 teams per school, with any additional teams added to a waiting list.
					One team (4-5 people) will be reserved for individuals' registration.
					You can join our <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/lmrIzupDuyjAk2N93">Mailing List</a> to receive 
					updates!
					<p>
				<b>Please note</b> that, although a school may register multiple teams, we require that each team be 
				accompanied by their own adult coach; this adult may be a parent, teacher, or otherwise, and must remain 
				with the team the whole day.
				</p> -->
				</p>
				<!--<p>
				Right here! There's a <a href="#register">registration form</a> at the bottom of this page. You have to sign up as an adult-sponsored team, so see if a teacher or parent will be willing to organize it!.
				</p>
				-->
			</div>
			
			<div class="box" id="faq-cost"><h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				<p>
				Zero dollars and zero cents. Our operational costs are pretty low, and they are all paid for thanks to sponsors and 
				by lunch pizza pre-orders - so you can support us by <a hred="#faq-sponsor">becoming a sponsor</a> or 
				<a href="#faq-eat">buying some pizza</a> on the day of event! 
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box" id="faq-practice"><h3>What do questions look like? How can I practice?</h3> <!-- edit this-->
				<p> 
				For the Lightning Rounds, National Science Bowl has a huge number of middle school science bowl 
				<a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/regional-competitions/resources/ms-sample-questions/">sample questions</a>, 
				and we also have 
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1fh8gDnqK4fU0hmTldtR3BjdVk">our</a> 
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yrv0VbYL3zDiyfmMWgWQg_KHaURexFZiRCu4WZXDAkI/edit">own</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the Olympiad Rounds, the high school olympiads are vastly more difficult, and as far as we know 
				this has never been done for middle school before. They will be somewhat similar to MCAS short-response 
				questions in format, and slightly greater in difficulty.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box" id="faq-eat"><h3>How will I eat?</h3>
				<p>
				Lunch will be during Breaktime<!--/Talktime, which is an hour and a half long and includes science talks!-->. You have a few options for lunch:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can pre-order whole pizzas for $9 per cheese pizza online ($11 for pepperoni) before the competition, 
					or during check-in at the competition for a higher charge.
					All profits go toward running LexSciBowl. 
					<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/FdQ4yDNri2Fw0alD3">Pre-order form is here</a></li>
					<li>You can go to Lexington Center, which is a few minutes' walk away. 
					Coaches or parents must accompany students.</li>
					<li>Finally, you can always pack your own lunch.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-bring"><h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>
				Typical test-taking implements (pencils, erasers). Note that calculators are not allowed. 
				You should also bring money to buy food (or a packed lunch). (See <a href="#faq-eat">How will I eat?</a>)
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box" id="faq-why"><h3>Why?</h3>
				<p>
				In November 2014, some members of our school Science Bowl team decided it might be cool to bring our 
				love of high school science bowl to middle schools in the region. The National Science Bowl has only a 
				relatively small Middle School division, and the International Science Olympiads seem to have no middle 
				school equivalent. Especially in Massachusetts, there are math leagues and competitions galore. Why not science?
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box" id="faq-parents"><h3>What do parents/coaches do?</h3>
				<p>
				As long as each team of 4-5 has one adult supervising at all times, you have the option of leaving or accompanying students to all Lightning rounds.
				</p>
			</div>
      <div class="box" id="faq-sponsor"><h3>Do you do sponsorships?</h3>
        <p>
          Yup! We'd love to have you. You can read our <a href="sponsor2017.pdf">sponsorship info</a> for more information.
        </p>
      </div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-idk"><h3>I still don't get it!</h3>
				<p>
				If you still have something to ask, please shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@lexscibowl.org">contact@lexscibowl.org</a>! We'll be happy to answer any questions you might have.
